#Assignment Task: This week, we will focus on understanding inheritance and polymorphism in Java. In your own words, what is the relationship between superclasses and subclasses in inheritance? Provide an example code segment in Java that illustrates inheritance and describes the superclass/subclass relationship. In response to your peers, provide constructive feedback on the relationships that were posted. Include additional code segments if applicable.
